            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PREFACE TO THE READER, Upon the following DISCOURSE, Å¿uited to the preÅ¿ent <hi>Juncture</hi> of Affairs in the World, and to the particular <hi>Signs</hi> of the <hi>Times</hi> now Emerging.</head>
            <p>THat which bore up the great Princes, and Leaders among the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God in Elder times, to Å¿uch a TranÅ¿cendency of Action, was immediate <hi>Revelation</hi> from <hi>God; The Word of God came to them,</hi> as ChriÅ¿t Å¿peaks, and ennobled them, as <hi>Gods</hi> upon <hi>Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Immediate <hi>Revelation</hi> in the Å¿ame manner bore up Å¿o High the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> that they feared none of the Powers upon Earth, how great, and formidable Å¿oever, in delivering the <hi>Divine MeÅ¿Å¿ages,</hi> even when they threatned them with that Ruine, which they knew would moÅ¿t en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them to Hear of.</p>
            <p>The very Å¿ame immediate <hi>Revelation, Å¿tirred</hi> up the <hi>Spirits</hi> of the <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ality of the Servants of God in <hi>Prayer,</hi> and Å¿uitable Action, Å¿o that they <hi>offered themÅ¿elves willingly</hi> to the Services of their <hi>Generation,</hi> even in the LoughtieÅ¿t Atchievements, when they knew themÅ¿elves Arm'd with the AÅ¿Å¿urances of the PurpoÅ¿es of God to be fulfilled in thoÅ¿e SeaÅ¿ons, wherein they were Å¿ummoned to Å¿uch Actions.</p>
            <p>That which next to Å¿uch immediate <hi>Revelation</hi> would now <hi>InÅ¿pire</hi> the Servants of God in each Station, to the higheÅ¿t Elevation, in Divine Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿tations
<pb facs="tcp:59786:3"/> to the World, in Prayer, and Action, muÅ¿t be a DiÅ¿covery of the <hi>Signs</hi> of the preÅ¿ent Time according to Å¿acred <hi>PropheÅ¿ie,</hi> and eÅ¿pecially that great <hi>PropheÅ¿ie</hi> of the <hi>New TeÅ¿tament,</hi> which is peculiarly entitled <hi>The Revelation;</hi> BecauÅ¿e it is and ought to be in the place of immediate <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> to All, who <hi>Read,</hi> and <hi>Hear</hi> it, and all the Servants of ChriÅ¿t ought to Read and Hear it. For it is the <hi>Revelation,</hi> that God gave to JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t to <hi>Å¿hew to his Servants, things that are Å¿hortly to come to paÅ¿s.</hi> And that Å¿hewing is plainly declar'd to be by their <hi>Reading,</hi> and <hi>Hearing:</hi> For it immediately follows ChriÅ¿ts <hi>Å¿hewing,</hi> and Å¿ignification of it by the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿timony,</hi> and <hi>Writing</hi> of his Servant <hi>John.</hi> For he is commanded to <hi>write</hi> for after Ages; And to encourage in Å¿uch <hi>Reading,</hi> and <hi>Hearing,</hi> There is a PromiÅ¿e of <hi>BleÅ¿Å¿edneÅ¿s</hi> adjoyn'd to the <hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Hearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not at all doubt, there is a myÅ¿tical <hi>Reading,</hi> and <hi>Hearing</hi> by the Spirit, and Power of ChriÅ¿t inÅ¿tructing and actuating his Servants, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Principles, and Services of this very <hi>PropheÅ¿ie.</hi> And that, what is now doing, and operating, in the World, and in our Nation, is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, without explicite underÅ¿tanding, or attending to the Explanation of it.</p>
            <p>But yet undoubtedly, a more open, and bold Explanation is due; eÅ¿peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to this <hi>Age</hi> of the <hi>Churches</hi> of ChriÅ¿t, and <hi>approach</hi> of his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> We ought now to be more skill'd in the <hi>Signs of the Times,</hi> than by a meer kind of <hi>Implicite Faith.</hi> And that muÅ¿t be by the Calculation of them according to this <hi>PropheÅ¿ie;</hi> for the <hi>Signs</hi> of the <hi>Times</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded eÅ¿pecially of the Definition of times by <hi>PropheÅ¿y,</hi> and the events de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd to <hi>come to paÅ¿s</hi> in thoÅ¿e Times, and our diÅ¿cerning the <hi>Signs of the Times,</hi> is to be by a compare of <hi>PropheÅ¿ie,</hi> and the product of Times, agreeable to the <hi>PropheÅ¿ie,</hi> together; even as the Time of <hi>MeÅ¿Å¿iahs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> was deÅ¿ign'd by the <hi>Å¿ure Word</hi> of <hi>Daniels PropheÅ¿y,</hi> and <hi>JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, mighty in Word and Deed, came</hi> at the Å¿ame Time. Now our Lord condemns the Ignorance of the <hi>Scribes, and PhariÅ¿ees,</hi> and <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> who did not <hi>diÅ¿cern the Signs</hi> of that <hi>Time,</hi> not as Å¿imple Ignorance, or NeÅ¿cience, but as groÅ¿s <hi>HipocriÅ¿ie,</hi> that they would not know what they might have known; and proportionably in all times, but eÅ¿pecially in theÅ¿e Times, wherein <hi>mighty Works</hi> are to <hi>Å¿hew forth themÅ¿elves,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to <hi>Å¿hew forth themÅ¿elves</hi> in the downfal of the <hi>TurkiÅ¿h Tyranny,</hi> with which the Papal is to meet in Å¿uch degrees of Ruine, as are determin'd to be parallel in each, and in parallel Times.</p>
            <p>I moÅ¿t humbly, and earneÅ¿tly threfore BeÅ¿eech the <hi>Angels</hi> of the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> That they would <hi>Å¿earch</hi> this Å¿o great <hi>PropheÅ¿ie</hi> of the <hi>New TeÅ¿tament,</hi> as commenÅ¿urate, as hath been Å¿aid to <hi>Immediate Revelation,</hi> and that they would MiniÅ¿ter out of it to the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Powers</hi> of the <hi>Ten Kingdoms,</hi> that have Å¿o long <hi>given their Power,</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> to the <hi>BeaÅ¿t,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59786:3"/> eÅ¿pecially to thoÅ¿e, which are already of the <hi>Reformation;</hi> For the <hi>Words of God</hi> are <hi>near to be fulfill'd,</hi> for God had Å¿aid, The <hi>BeaÅ¿t</hi> Å¿hall have <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>continue Forty two Months,</hi> and to <hi>receive great Power,</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> from thoÅ¿e <hi>Kings,</hi> giving their <hi>Power,</hi> and their <hi>Kingdom</hi> to Him. And the <hi>Word</hi> of God was <hi>fulfill'd,</hi> Å¿o that their <hi>Kingdoms</hi> were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely Å¿o <hi>given</hi> till the <hi>Reformation,</hi> when the Morning of the laÅ¿t <hi>half Day,</hi> or half <hi>Time of the forty two Months,</hi> gave Liberty to Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e <hi>Ten Kings</hi> to reverÅ¿e, and recal the <hi>giving of their Kingdom:</hi> As ChriÅ¿t aroÅ¿e early in the <hi>Morning</hi> of his laÅ¿t <hi>third Day,</hi> and appeared to Å¿ome of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tles,</hi> and <hi>DiÅ¿ciples;</hi> But it was Evening, e're he met them in a Body; and thoÅ¿e, who Å¿aw him firÅ¿t, were InÅ¿trumental to prepare thoÅ¿e, who did not Å¿ee him till the <hi>Evening:</hi> Å¿o thoÅ¿e <hi>Princes</hi> already of the <hi>Reformation</hi> Å¿hall be InÅ¿trumental to oblige the reÅ¿t, who have not yet renunciated to the <hi>BeaÅ¿t</hi> and the <hi>falÅ¿e Church,</hi> to do the Å¿ame, now near the End of the laÅ¿t of the forty two Months.</p>
            <p>Let them therefore have thoÅ¿e grand excitements, and encouragements of <hi>PropheÅ¿ie;</hi> undoubtedly <hi>Cyrus</hi> though a <hi>Gentile</hi> Prince was highly anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the PropheÅ¿ies of <hi>IÅ¿aiah</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> for the DeÅ¿truction of <hi>Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Babylon,</hi> which PropheÅ¿ies we may be aÅ¿Å¿ured were expounded to Him by <hi>Daniel,</hi> Å¿o great a <hi>Prophet</hi> in his own Times; how much more will <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tian,</hi> and <hi>ProteÅ¿tant</hi> Princes, exalted in their Spirits, Å¿ummon their Prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿Å¿e, and puiÅ¿Å¿ance for the Å¿ervice of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>JeÅ¿us</hi> ChriÅ¿t to be within theÅ¿e Eight next Years <hi>proclaim'd</hi> by <hi>loud Voices</hi> from <hi>Heaven:</hi> For when the <hi>Words of God</hi> are to be <hi>fulfill'd,</hi> that the <hi>Ten Kings</hi> and their <hi>Nations,</hi> do <hi>give</hi> their <hi>Power</hi> no longer to <hi>the BeaÅ¿t;</hi> Then the <hi>Kingdom of ChriÅ¿t</hi> is <hi>proclaim'd,</hi> although his <hi>Inauguration,</hi> as we Å¿peak, Å¿hall not be till Å¿eventy five Years after.</p>
            <p>If any Å¿hould Å¿ay, the <hi>PropheÅ¿ie</hi> is <hi>dark</hi> and not to be <hi>underÅ¿tood,</hi> and Men very diÅ¿enclin'd to believe the Explications given of it; let them conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it is very dangerous to Å¿ay of any <hi>Book of Scripture,</hi> with the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned,</hi> we <hi>cannot read</hi> it, becauÅ¿e we are not <hi>learned,</hi> and with the <hi>learned,</hi> we cannot <hi>read</hi> it <hi>becauÅ¿e it is Å¿ealed.</hi> If there were by the <hi>pouring</hi> out of the <hi>Spirit</hi> upon the <hi>Reformed</hi> an united endeavour to <hi>Å¿earch</hi> by the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and other <hi>EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tical Records</hi> with <hi>Prayer, what,</hi> and <hi>what manner of Time,</hi> the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> in it did <hi>Å¿ignifie,</hi> as they have Å¿earch'd for the SenÅ¿e of <hi>Antiquity</hi> in Å¿ome things of far leÅ¿s moment, or concern to the <hi>Kingdom of ChriÅ¿t,</hi> what doubt can there be but that the <hi>two leaved Gates of Truth</hi> in it had <hi>open'd</hi> to them; and by their concerted Light, and Authority, Princes would be awaken'd, and perÅ¿wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, Å¿o that the <hi>great City,</hi> and its <hi>Decimal power</hi> would Å¿oon <hi>feel</hi> the <hi>Earthquake,</hi> and <hi>fall.</hi>

            <p>Particularly the annexed DiÅ¿courÅ¿e, I publiÅ¿h'd a year ago, and I cannot but look upon the preÅ¿ent appearance of things in the World a JuÅ¿tification of it: I have obÅ¿erv'd hitherto a very wonderful progreÅ¿s of <hi>Divine Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in the World, according to the Calculation of <hi>PropheÅ¿ie</hi> I have made. I obÅ¿erve a great Preparation for the CeÅ¿Å¿ation of the <hi>TurkiÅ¿h Woe,</hi> upon the <hi>Imperial ConÅ¿tantinople</hi> and the <hi>Greek Cities,</hi> that thoÅ¿e <hi>Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ticks</hi> may be Re-placed: I obÅ¿erve yet, This Å¿eems to wait for the <hi>Fall of the Tenth</hi> of the <hi>great City,</hi> which motion it is to attend: I have been always of the Judgment, the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> that lye in the Bowels of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whoÅ¿e <hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>Staple Laws</hi> had not eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed the <hi>Reformation,</hi> were in Danger of freÅ¿h <hi>Martyrdoms</hi> by the cruel Policies of the <hi>JeÅ¿uites Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> whoÅ¿e <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> or <hi>Politics,</hi> may well be Å¿tyl'd the <hi>depths of Sathan.</hi> I have underÅ¿tood thoÅ¿e Churches Å¿ymbol'd by the Church of <hi>Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira,</hi> in regard of whom the <hi>Feet of ChriÅ¿t burn as in a Furnace</hi> to this day.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Nations,</hi> whoÅ¿e <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> have eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h'd the <hi>Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> I have had firm AÅ¿Å¿urance, could not be re-enÅ¿lav'd, under the enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ReÅ¿toring that <hi>Power to the BeaÅ¿t,</hi> which they had repeal'd from him, nor Å¿hould the <hi>Churches</hi> in them, except by a Å¿hort <hi>Hurricane,</hi> be in any danger of force. I have had the Å¿ame Confidence with particular Relation to this Nation, and the <hi>Churches</hi> in it, and that the <hi>Soveraign Power</hi> of it Å¿hall be of the principal, that Å¿hall perfect that <hi>Revolution</hi> of the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> into it's Complement, and on that account have pray'd for the good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tanding of our <hi>Supreams</hi> to that very end.</p>
            <p>I have compar'd Å¿uch <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> and particularly this, to
<pb facs="tcp:59786:4"/> that of <hi>Sardis,</hi> eÅ¿teeming our greateÅ¿t danger to be a Security, a <hi>Å¿lumber</hi> in a State though Å¿plendid as to this World, yet Å¿hort of the Glory intended by ChriÅ¿t in the Advances of his <hi>Kingdom;</hi> and that thereupon, he would <hi>come upon us,</hi> and <hi>we Å¿hould not know</hi> at <hi>what hour he himÅ¿elf would come upon us.</hi> I find no ReaÅ¿on to change, or Å¿o much as to Å¿uÅ¿pect, but to be more and more confirm'd in theÅ¿e Sentiments.</p>
            <p>I make no more doubt, the <hi>preÅ¿ent Conjuncture,</hi> is a dawn of that great Revolution, awaiting the Year <hi>ninety Å¿even,</hi> next enÅ¿uing, than I doubt, whether the dawn of the day be in advance to the perfect Light; becauÅ¿e I am not upon any Å¿ingle Conjecture, but upon the whole ConÅ¿piration of <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyptical Times,</hi> compar'd with the RegiÅ¿tries of <hi>HiÅ¿tory</hi> in the courÅ¿e of Time Å¿ince our <hi>Lords ReÅ¿urrection,</hi> as famous, and as well known, as the <hi>Reformation</hi> from <hi>Luthers</hi> Time is known. I am not on any Å¿ingle <hi>Line of Time,</hi> but upon the Concatenation of Times throughout <hi>Scripture,</hi> not as it is perplex'd with the Irreconcileable <hi>Chronological</hi> ControverÅ¿ies, but aÅ¿Å¿ur'd by MaÅ¿Å¿y, Sterlyn <hi>Scripture,</hi> both by compare of the <hi>Texts</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves, and <hi>Scripture ReaÅ¿on,</hi> argued from them.</p>
            <p>I have only three parts of that Line <hi>to</hi> publiÅ¿h, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Abraham</hi> to the <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of</hi> Egypt, from the <hi>going out of</hi> Egypt to <hi>Solomons beginning</hi> the <hi>Temple,</hi> and from the <hi>Temple begun</hi> to <hi>Cyrus</hi> his <hi>Decree</hi> for reÅ¿to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, after the <hi>BabyloniÅ¿h</hi> DevaÅ¿tation. I have alÅ¿o prepar'd Å¿o great a Probation, that the <hi>day of Judgment,</hi> and the <hi>ReÅ¿urrection</hi> Å¿o generally acknowledg'd in <hi>ChriÅ¿tian Doctrine,</hi> are at the full dimenÅ¿ions of ExpoÅ¿ition the very <hi>Milennial,</hi> or <hi>thouÅ¿and years, Kingdom of ChriÅ¿t,</hi> that I think upon the comparing of <hi>Scriptures,</hi> I have vouch'd and argued, it cannot be denyed; and as a Complement of all, I have adjuÅ¿ted to thoÅ¿e IlluÅ¿trious Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the <hi>Prayer,</hi> we Å¿o generally acknowledge by the Name of the <hi>Lords prayer</hi> in the Explanation of it, and proved it to be the <hi>Prayer</hi> of, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for that <hi>Glorious Kingdom of ChriÅ¿t,</hi> as alÅ¿o by eminent Scriptures the Lords Supper to be the Sacrament of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>I hope by the <hi>good Hand</hi> of God towards me to be Å¿o aÅ¿Å¿isted, as to make Publication of theÅ¿e with the great, and confiding Expectation; that Å¿ince I have had Å¿o great cauÅ¿e to believe, no one Å¿ees ReaÅ¿on to chaÅ¿tiÅ¿e the DiÅ¿cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es I have publiÅ¿h'd, and that the <hi>Divine AdminiÅ¿trations</hi> of theÅ¿e latter Times, are going on to juÅ¿tifie them, they will be Å¿erviceable as <hi>Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Indeed I have been always much aÅ¿Å¿ur'd, and God hath verified it, Each <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that repriz'd it Å¿elf from the <hi>Power of the BeaÅ¿t</hi> Å¿hall be a <hi>ProteÅ¿tant Kingdom</hi> to the very laÅ¿t; and that it could not have any EÅ¿tabliÅ¿h'd Prince, that was not <hi>ProteÅ¿tant</hi> alÅ¿o; for God will not give back what he hath reÅ¿cued; Å¿o that among them the <hi>killing of the WitneÅ¿Å¿es</hi> can have no proper place any more, I am aÅ¿Å¿ured according to PropheÅ¿ie.</p>

               <p>Certainly this is a very Memorable fulfilling of this <hi>PropheÅ¿ie,</hi> and I am moÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿ur'd, it is for a <hi>Sign to the Lord,</hi> that Å¿hall not be <hi>Cut off,</hi> till the whole be <hi>fulfilled,</hi> and it ought to be Å¿et up for a <hi>Memorial</hi> before the <hi>Lord,</hi> as in the <hi>Temple</hi> of the <hi>ProteÅ¿tant Churches.</hi>

               <p>I know, Å¿omething like it fell out in our Neighbour Kingdom, concerning <hi>Henry the Fourth,</hi> and the <hi>Great of France,</hi> Grand-father of our King, and Great Grand-father of our Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> There was at that time in that <hi>Nation</hi> an univerÅ¿al <hi>Zeal</hi> againÅ¿t the <hi>Reformation,</hi> which they call'd <hi>HereÅ¿ie,</hi> Å¿o that they would by no means receive a Prince, how great Å¿oever his Character was, as it was indeed, as great as any Princes of his time, though there was at that time a Complex of great Princes in the World; they could not receive him how undoubted Å¿oever his Right according to their <hi>Salique Law:</hi> But he was under a neceÅ¿Å¿ity to forfeit his Right, to live in a perpetual War, or to change his <hi>Communion,</hi> upon what he did, Draw a Curtain in Honour to the Memory of Å¿o <hi>Heroick</hi> a Name.</p>
               <p>But was not this alÅ¿o a great <hi>fulfilling</hi> of this very <hi>PropheÅ¿ie</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Å¿eaÅ¿on? For at that time, when Å¿everal Princes had withdrawn themÅ¿elves and their <hi>Kingdoms</hi> from the <hi>Anti-chriÅ¿tian</hi> UÅ¿urpation, if all had done Å¿o, how had the <hi>words</hi> of <hi>God</hi> been <hi>fulfill'd, giving the BeaÅ¿t Forty Two Months</hi> of Å¿uch a <hi>Decem-Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality</hi> or <hi>Ten Horned Power</hi> when above an Hundred Years at that time were unexpir'd? It pleaÅ¿ed God to take the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to RevulÅ¿e Å¿ome of them from him, to give public notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, It was the <hi>Morning</hi> of the <hi>half Time,</hi> and we are even now to be admoniÅ¿h'd by it; on the other Å¿ide Å¿ome great Kings were to continue united to him, to Å¿how the <hi>half Time</hi> was not run

               <p>In another regard alÅ¿o <hi>PropheÅ¿ie</hi> was hereby <hi>fulfilled;</hi> for by that <hi>Great</hi> Henry <hi>the Fourth of</hi> France, that Famous <hi>Edict of Nants</hi> was Granted, and Confirm'd in favour of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> of which he had been Å¿o great a <hi>ConfeÅ¿Å¿our</hi> and <hi>Champion;</hi> that thereby, in <hi>France,</hi> as in <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi> and Å¿ome other Countries, <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Thyatyra</hi> might be Å¿ettled, lying among the <hi>Nations,</hi> where the CounÅ¿els of the <hi>Ignatian,</hi> or <hi>JeÅ¿uits Order,</hi> Å¿uperadded to other Orders, juÅ¿tly eÅ¿teem'd, and call'd by <hi>ProteÅ¿tants</hi> (or as <hi>They, viz.

               <p>And thus wonderfully hath God Counterpoiz'd the State of the <hi>BeaÅ¿ts Kingdom,</hi> and the <hi>Reformation,</hi> during this <hi>half Time</hi> acccor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>PropheÅ¿ie,</hi> giving yet the inclining, and heavyer Scale to the <hi>BeaÅ¿t,</hi> that his <hi>words may be fulfilled,</hi> until the <hi>BeaÅ¿ts MeaÅ¿ure</hi> be <hi>heaped up,</hi> and <hi>running over.</hi>
